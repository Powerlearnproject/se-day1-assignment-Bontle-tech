Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
= Software Engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software(s). 
Its importance is:

1. *reliability* it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications such as healthcare/finace.
   
3. *efficiency* it helps to optimise developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
   
4. *scalability and flexibility* it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
   
5. *security* implementing protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
= Mastering complexity, Mastering process and Mastering machine.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
= Planning - identify the software requirement(s) or purpose and scope.
Requirement planning - identify the final user specification.
Design - building the framework.
Coding - converting the software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
= • Waterfall methodology
- linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.
- there is low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- testing is done at the end of the development process.
  
  • Agile methodology
- iterative and incremental, with multiple cyccles/sprints.
- high flexibility, adapts to changing requirements.
- regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
- testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
  



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
= The role of a Sotfware Developer in a software engineering team is to develop applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
The responsibilities include:
- maintaining and updating softwares to keep it functional.
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
- reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

The role of a Quality Assurance Engineer in a software engineering team is to collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify the software requirements.
The responsibilities include:
- creating development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow.
- confirming that the software meets the requirements before deployment.
- analysing the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.
- developing and executing automation scripts using open-sourced tools.

The role of a Project Manager in a software engineering team is to assemble and lead the software development team.
The responsibilities include: 
- discussing the project and its requirements with the client and software development team.
- creating the blueprint for the project.
- tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
- delivering the complete software to the client and regularly checking its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
= Importance of Integrated Development Environments:
- formats the written text by automatically making some words bold/italic , or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
  


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
